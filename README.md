Image to Text
-------------

This will extract text from an image in base64. This uses the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/).

This can be used as a [Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) and is meant to work in tandem with the sample [image recognition website](https://github.com/haoyee-dev/image_recognition_site)
